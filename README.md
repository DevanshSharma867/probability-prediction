This project utilized machine learning to predict student scholarship eligibility.  Income data, academic performance, and other student details were collected and underwent cleaning and formatting. Missing values were addressed, data types were converted as needed, and non-numerical information like mentor streams was encoded.  A "Scholarship" target variable was defined based on specific income and academic criteria. The data was then split for training and testing purposes. Two models, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, were trained and fine-tuned, with the latter undergoing hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV. Model performance was evaluated through metrics like ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, and recall, resulting in significant results. Finally, scholarship eligibility probabilities were calculated for the entire dataset, with adjustments made for invalid entries and duplicates. This project demonstrates the creation of a high-accuracy and reliable model to support fair allocation of scholarships.

Unfortunately due to privacy and other restrictions the main csv files from which the data is imported can not be uploaded to github.
